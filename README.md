# Triangle rasterization with exact antialising on pure C#

This is a C# WPF demo application with implemented on pure C# written triangle rasterization algorithm with exact sub-pixel antialising calculations. Color of a pixel determines from an area of triange covers on that pixel. Only grey levels are supported. No colors.

## How does it work?

* Implementation of [Bresenham Triangle Rasterization](http://www.sunshine2k.de/coding/java/TriangleRasterization/TriangleRasterization.html#algo3) with additional antialising.
* Triangle sides are determined using [bresenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm)
* Application visualizes a resilt in interface as shown on screenshot below

* InteractiveDataDisplay library was used for visualization.
* Geometrical calculations is on [GeoGebra](https://ggbm.at/ytbgvphv)

## How to install and use.

A solution was made in Visual Studio 2017. For using just compile and run it.

There is need to change visualization according to following image
